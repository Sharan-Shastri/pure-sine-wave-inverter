## 1KW Pure Sine Wave Inverter Design Project 
The repository  contains all the necessary files and instructions to design a pure sine wave inverter from scratch using off-the -shelf components. 

The project was funded by IEEE PES. Honestly speaking this was my first power electronics project. So This was a roller coster ride for me in 2015. It took almost one year to successfully complete the project. Designing an Inverter from scratch is really challenging. So I hope this project will show the path to the newcomer who wants to design Inverter for learning purpose.

Remember this is not a product type project. This project is intended to teach how to desing an inverter from scratch. 

The project files inculde 
 - Source Code 
 - All the Schematics
 - PCB design PDF file 
 - Fabrication Report 
 - Bill of Materials(BOM)

 Read the fabrication report carefully before building the project.
